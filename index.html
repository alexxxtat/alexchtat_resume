          Hi, I am<br />
          Alex Chou. <br />
          Nice to see you here!
        </h1>
        <p>
          I am an international student from Hong kong. I have been in Canada
          for almost 5 years and I recently finished my Computer Science degree
          at Simon Fraser University. I am keen on software development. I have
          enrolled in different courses about software engineering. This helps
          me build strong fundamentals of data structure, programming skills and
          understanding the working flow. I have designed a game using Java with
          3 teammates. During this project, I have understood the whole process
          of an application and used BFS to boost the enemy reaction time and
          solve some bugs. I did not have Java experience before and picked up
          the skills during the project in a month and accomplish the project
          well. well.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am willing to solve some real-life problems and enjoy working with
          extremely talented people. I developed a dating website using MERN
          stack in 2 months with 4 teammates. During each project can gain me
          some new skills and a better understanding of different concepts and
          much more understanding of the user needs. I have designed the
          database schema depending on the application need and embedded
          connection with Instagram photos by the user agreement and Twitch
          stream to the website using API
        </p>
        <p>
          Data analytics is one of my interest areas. I have studied a static
          minor based on my interest in university life. A different area of
          interest can open my eyes and stimulate my thirst for knowledge. I
          would love to work more in both data analytics and software
          development areas.
        </p>
